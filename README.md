<h1>What is MNIST?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Set of 70,000 small images of digits handwritten by high school students and employees of the US causes Bureau.</li>
<li>All images are labeled with the respective digit they represent.</li>
<li>MNIST is the hello world of machine learning. Every time a data scientist or machine learning engineer makes a new algorithm for classification, they would always first check its performance on the MNIST dataset.</li>
<li>There are 70,000 images and each image has 28*28 = 784 features.</li>
<li>Each image is 28*28 pixels and each feature simply represents one-pixel intensity from 0 to 255. If the intensity is 0, it means that the pixel is white and if it is 255, it means it is black.</li>
